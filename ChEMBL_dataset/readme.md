# Pipeline to obtain compounds and targets information from ChEMBL for SARS-CoV-2 


#### Here we provide two Jupyter notebooks to obtain drugs associated with SARS-CoV-2:
+ The first is <a href="https://github.com/ramirezlab/COVID-protein-drug-network/blob/main/ChEMBL_dataset/ChEMBL_compounds_targets.ipynb" target="_blank"><b>ChEMBL compound targets</b></a> to find the targets of a determined compound in ChEMBL.
+ And, the second one is <a href="https://github.com/ramirezlab/COVID-protein-drug-network/blob/main/ChEMBL_dataset/Filtering_drugs.ipynb" target="_blank"><b>filtering drugs</b></a> to filter drugs based on their activities values.
