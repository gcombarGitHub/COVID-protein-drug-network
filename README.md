## Abstract
In this work we have collected information regarding the protein-virus interaction and also the protein-drug interaction, representing these data as a network that allows a more visual analysis. Additionally, considering this information we have obtained statistical metrics of the networks. This data analysis has allowed us to obtain relevant information on which proteins and drugs are the most relevant in this interaction network. This method not only allows us to focus on viral proteins as the main targets in the COVID19 disease, but also reveals that some human proteins could be important in the study of drug repurposing.

## About this repository
To support our analysis we have reported the steps to obtain the information from Chembl databases as well as its processing. In addition you will find information about the further analysis of the networks using R.
